# coin-flip

### Your Challenge

1.  Create a coinflip.py file.
1.  In coinflip.py, you need to use functions from the random module.
1.  Make a function flip that takes in a number of times to flip the coin.
1.  For each time the coin is flipped, display "Heads" or "Tails" based on the random number chosen.
1.  Below this function, ask the user how many times they would like to flip.
1.  Call flip() with the number the user chose.
1.  Once it works, find a way to keep count of how many heads and how many tails were flipped, and have the flip() function print this count. Then, test your function with a larger number like 1000.
